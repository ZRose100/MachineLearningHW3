# MachineLearningHW3

After running many different iterations, the best accuracy I got was this version at ~0.31. I ran many iterations changing training rate, epochs, and batch size, and got mostly zeroes for my accuracy, so I was very pleased with this final iteration. I was unable to add the checkpoint file to this repository as it was too big, so it will be uploaded directly to eLearning instead.
